      <h2>“This update sucks” -update</h2>
      <br>
      <b>Major stuff:</b><br>
      TIME DILATION<br>
      3 ROWS OF SECRET ACHIEVEMENTS<br>
      Added more Nicholas Cage.<br>
      1 new row of achievements.<br>
      Added 3 study tree save slots.<br>
      Greatly improved performance. (up to 5x in certain cases, ~3x in almost all cases)<br>
      Nerfed EC10 reward. ((infinities * EC10 completions * 0.000002+1) > (infinities ^ 0.9 * EC10 completions * 0.000002+1))<br>
      Added even more Nicholas Cage.<br>
      Time study 11 has been capped at 1e2500 and now displays its current multiplier.<br>
      Time study 193 has been buffed, requires ~1012680 eternities to cap, rather than 1.5m, and is now capped at 1e13000 instead of ~1.81e12900/1.5m eternities. (1.02^x) > (1.03^x)<br>
      The second eternity upgrade has been buffed, and now soft caps at 100k, rather than 125k. The end result is very slightly higher. ((x/300)^log4(2x)) > ((x/200)^log4(2x))<br>
      EC1 now requires 20k eternities per tier to unlock, down from 25k.<br>
      TD cost scaling has been increased after costs of 1e1300. (this is in addition to the current increase)<br>
      Added additional galaxy cost scaling after 800 galaxies.<br>
      Added a button to buy the maximum amount of eternity point multipliers at once.<br>
      Offline progress processes ~5x faster, and now simulates autobuyers. (please note that offline progress is still capped at 1000 ticks, with additional ticks increasing the production of said 1000 ticks)<br>
      Added a new save file system that allows 3 different save files at once all with cloud save enabled, along with a new cloud save UI.<br>
      Added an animation to visualize your multiplier gain when you purchase 10 of a dimension, dimension boost/shift, or sacrifice.<br>
      Nicholas Cage.<br>
      Added an animation to big crunches. This will only trigger if you haven’t eternitied, have a fastest infinity time above 1 minute, and haven’t broken infinity.<br>
      Added a button in the options menu to disable individual animations.<br>
      Added more news ticker entries<br><br>
      <b>Minor stuff:</b><br>
      Reduced the space between the secondary eternity tab buttons.<br>
      The EC3 description now specifies that dimensional sacrifice is disabled.<br>
      Autobuyer inputs now support commas and notation on exponents.<br>
      When purchasing the EP or IP multipliers, autobuyer inputs will now always format the updated value above 1000.<br>
      The size and placement of the auto IP multiplier and auto RG toggles have been adjusted to fit with the other auto toggles.<br>
      Total time played now increases at a normal rate inside EC12.<br>
      Fastest infinity time now updates normally inside EC12.<br>
      The time theorem purchasing background is now 20 pixels wider.<br>
      Changed the wording on time study 133 for clarity.<br>
      Added various missing periods to achievements.<br>
      Improved chart performance. (it’s still pretty laggy if your settings are too high)<br>
      You can now purchase study 201 while you have EC11/12 bought, but you cannot purchase another path.<br>
      Purchasing study 131 no longer turns off your replicanti galaxy autobuyer, but instead displays it as disabled.<br>
      You can now purchase another split using shift while you have study 201.<br>
      You now purchase max galaxies manually by clicking or using the hotkey with more than 6 eternities.<br>
      You can now purchase single dimension boosts and galaxies by holding shift while purchasing.<br>
      ID8 will now display a rate of change after completing EC7 at least once.<br>
      Added an oxford comma to formatted time values.<br>
      Made the dimensional sacrifice button 40px wider to prevent the text overflowing.<br>
      Made the all tab eternity and infinity point displays 30px wider to prevent the text overflowing.<br>
      Moved the big crunch button up to prevent blocking the statistics and achievement tab buttons.<br>
      Moved the eternity and infinity buttons inwards to prevent the HTML layout jumping around.<br>

      Fixed a bug where tickspeed elements wouldn’t hide correctly in certain cases.<br>
      Fixed a bug where bought eternity challenge unlock studies would show as gray in the dark theme rather than a deep purple.<br>

          Fixed a bug where the big crunch autobuyer said "X times since last crunch" instead of "X times last crunch".<br>

          Fixed a bug where secondary statistic tabs weren't hiding upon import.<br>
          
          Fixed a bug where replicanti galaxies wouldn't give a bonus if you had less than 3 galaxies.<br>
          
          Fixed a bug where the dimension boost autobuyer would ignore dimension boost costs until they costed 8th dimensions.<br>
